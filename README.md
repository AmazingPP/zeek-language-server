Language server for Zeek script
===============================

This project implements a
[language server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
for [Zeek](https://zeek.org/) script.

This is pre-alpha software which implements almost no useful features.

Parsing is handled by <https://github.com/ckreibich/tree-sitter-zeek-src>.
